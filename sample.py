Some experts believe that it is better for children to begin learning a foreign language at primary school rather than secondary school.
      Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?

Knowing foreign languages often opens doors to success.  It has been debated that learning a foreign language at the elementary level instead of secondary school offers more merits. This essay will elaborate on the gains and drawbacks of this approach, ultimately arguing that the benefits of studying a foreign language in primary school outweigh its negative points.

The obvious argument in its favor is that younger children have greater learning abilities. Our minds gradually fill with more information, shaping our personality and ego. Additionally, gray brain cells decline, making it harder to capture and understand new concepts. Consider boys and girls in primary school who have fewer life concerns and clear minds, allowing them to learn a foreign language more effortlessly.

Furthermore, learning a foreign language early gives young students more time to enhance their proficiency level, enabling them to improve all language skills, since learning a new language is challenging and requires sufficient time to master it. For instance, 
an adult student in a college struggling with his writing skills can hardly develop an article. If he had started acquiring his language skills from an early age, definitely he could have benefited from more opportunities to do so.

There are, however, some disadvantages. to name a few, learning a foreign language in primary school requires adding extra sessions to the curriculum, leading students to spend more time at school. Imagine some students with lower levels of concentration who hardly stay engaged in school for essential courses, let alone adding an extracurricular language course. As a result, not only a cluster of students do not learn a foreign language but also struggle to learn the basic curriculum sufficiently. 

To sum up, although attending a foreign language course in primary school might raise concerns about less focused students, there are some positive points—such as the greater learning capacity of younger students and having more time— which outweigh its downsides.
