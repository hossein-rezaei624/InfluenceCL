# Some people think that the government should provide free education at every level. However, some say that individuals should pay for their university education.
        Discuss both views and give your opinion.  

The debate surrounding whether the authorities in charge should provide free education for all levels, including primary, secondary, and higher education, has gained significant traction in recent years. Advocates claim that education, as a fundamental right, should be accessible to all, while opponents assert that individuals should be responsible for the financial issues of their higher education. This essay will elaborate on both perspectives before concluding with a personal viewpoint.  

On one hand, the proponents of free education contend that the opportunity for free education is a human right and the government by allocating funds and grants to this matter should pave the way for pupils.  It is worth noting that education can open new doors to a highly qualified life for almost all citizens. Imagine some underdeveloped countries, like African nations, where people suffer from class differences.  The lack of studying at no cost can make the rich richer and the poor poorer.  

On the other hand, critics argue that those who want to attend a university for a higher degree should be responsible for corresponding tuition fees as it is a personal investment that leads to a higher salary in the future of these dedicated people. In other words, paying this cost by the government brings higher taxes for all citizens. There is a cluster of people who usually donâ€™t want to enroll in universities so the authorities in charge should behave fairly among people of a society rather than assigning a huge portion of the budget for higher degrees.

In my view, while the arguments for free education at all levels have their own merits, the financial responsibility for higher education far outweighs its drawbacks. Universities can create links to prestigious companies and connect faculties to industrial projects where huge grants are defined. In this way, not only citizens do not bear more taxes, but also students can receive funds from companies and pay their tuition fees.  

To sum up, the discussion surrounding free education is complex and multifaceted. While there exist valid arguments on both sides, the overarching goal should be creating a fair and suitable education system where school fees will be free and university tuition fees handled by industries.
