However, it can be facilitated by some approaches. It has been debated that team learning can bring more merits than learning independently. I am of the opinion that collaborative studying brings more benefits. This essay will elaborate on two primary reasons to justify this position.  To commence with, studying with others as a team significantly increases the chance of interacting with knowledgeable people. In this regard, pupils can leverage the wisdom of educated people to facilitate their learning. Imagine a team collaboration in which individuals come from different learning systems and backgrounds. Discussing new concepts with higher-level students not only leads to deep understanding but also advanced horizons among lower-level ones. Moreover, it makes a robust learning process where senior ones correct the faults of sophomores with a great stream of scaffolding considering the fact that the amount of time that a teacher can allocate to each one is limited.  Furthermore, being a part of a learning group can improve our communication skills.  To clarify, listening to shared ideas from all participants about a complex problem and then sharing our own perspectives on the topic can enhance our interaction skills. Imagine shy and introverted individuals attending a group discussion. In this case, when these individuals exchange opinions in a non-judgmental environment and receive impactful feedback, it helps develop their interaction capacity.  On the other hand, learning in a group can bring more merits when students discuss various aspects of a topic without interrupting others, especially when someone needs more focus. For example, those with ADHD often struggle to stay focused, and even a small noise can be distracting.  To sum up, it can be argued that while individual learning has its own merits, collaborative learning can increase opportunities to engage with higher order ones, and also augment some essential abilities such as communicative skills. As the positive impacts of such an approach have been widely demonstrated in the literature, it is highly recommended to extend it more seriously.
