    What can make an advertisement effective? 
    Do you think advertisements are a bad thing or a good thing for society?

In this day and age, advertisements play a pivotal role in marketing. It has been debated that favored corporations sell more by leveraging advertisements. This essay not only elaborates on factors that enhance the effectiveness of advertisements but also discusses their pros and cons on individuals.

Two main approaches that make an advertisement appropriate are targeting the right audiences and ensuring high-quality content. More specifically, corporations should tailor advertisements based on the age range of targeted audiences. For example, if a product is a toy, the targeted audiences are children, so it is appropriate that the atmosphere of the advertisement appeals to young girls and boys. Additionally, it should be eye-catching, attractive, and highly qualified so that targeted groups will be encouraged to purchase it. For example, incorporating some humorous scenes and a catchy background song can attract the younger generation to the product.

On the other hand, advertisements can have both positive and negative impacts on the populace. On the positive side, they can help us to find products or services we have already been searching for. To illustrate, consider a crucial tool for your career that you have been unable to find in stores. Suddenly, an online shop advertisement appears on YouTube, allowing you to easily order it. In contrast, advertisements can also have negative effects. When individuals are bombarded and overwhelmed by tons of commercials, consumerism may increase. For instance, a catchy ad on television promoting fast food that lacks sufficient nutrition can encourage unhealthy diets.

To sum up, considering the targeted group of a product and also ensuring the quality of commercials enables companies to purchase more. On the other side, while advertising can bring some advantages—such as facilitating the process of finding a product—it may advance consumerism and encourage poor nutritious diets.
