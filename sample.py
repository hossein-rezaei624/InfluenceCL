Some experts believe that it is better for children to begin learning a foreign language at primary school rather than secondary school.
      Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?

Knowing foreign languages often opens doors to success.  It has been debated that learning a foreign language at primary school instead of secondary school offers more merits. This essay will elaborate on the gains and drawbacks of this approach, ultimately arguing that the benefits of studying a foreign language in primary school outweigh its negative points.

The obvious argument in its favor is that younger children have greater learning abilities. Our minds gradually fill with more information, shaping our personality and ego. Additionally, gray brain cells decline, making it harder to capture and understand new concepts. In contrast, consider boys and girls in primary school who have fewer life concerns and clear minds, allowing them to learn a foreign language more quickly.

Furthermore, learning a foreign language early gives us more time to enhance proficiency, enabling us to improve all language skills. Learning a new language is challenging and requires sufficient time to master it. For instance, students who struggle with writing skills can benefit from learning sooner, as it provides more opportunities to advance all their skills equally in the targeted language.

There are, however, some disadvantages. Learning a foreign language in primary school requires adding extra sessions to the curriculum, resulting in students spending more time at school. Imagine some lazy students who hardly stay engaged in school for existing courses, let alone even adding a new course. As a result, not only a cluster of students do not learn a foreign language but also struggle to learn the existing curriculum sufficiently. 

To sum up, although attending a foreign language course in primary school might raise concerns about lazy students, these issues can be managed through policies that encourage all students to get involved.  In this way, the positive points—such as the greater learning capacity of younger students and having more time—outweigh the downsides.
