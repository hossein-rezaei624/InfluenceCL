    Do you think advertisements are a bad thing or a good thing for society?

In this day and age, advertisements play a pivotal role in marketing. It has been debated that favored corporations sell more by leveraging promotions. This essay not only elaborates on factors that enhance the effectiveness of adverts but also discusses their pros and cons on individuals.

Two main approaches that make an ad proper are targeting the right audiences and ensuring high-quality content. More specifically, corporations should tailor advertisements based on the age range of intended viewers. For example, if a product is a toy, the primary audiences are children, so it is crucial for the advertisement's atmosphere to engage both young girls and boys effectively. Additionally, it should be informative, creative, and eye-catching so that specific groups will be encouraged to purchase the relevant product. For example, a car ad designed by BMW that shows the durability of automobile components under various complex and unique tests can provide the high quality of their product, enabling customers to make a prudent selection.

On the other hand, advertisements can have both positive and negative impacts on the populace. On the bright side, they can help us to find products or services that facilitate our jobs. For example, for washing the dishes you have already spent a lot of time while an ad introduces a dishwasher which washes the dishes easily. In contrast, when individuals are bombarded and overwhelmed by tons of commercials, consumerism may increase. For instance, some celebrities hired by some companies promote new luxury products like expensive watches, and luxury automobiles, encouraging people to lavishly spend on unnecessary goods.

To sum up, considering the targeted group of a product and also ensuring the quality of commercials enables companies to sell more. Interestingly, while advertising can bring some advantages—such as facilitating the process of finding a product—it may advance consumerism.
